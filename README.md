# DNS Simulator

  

In this guide, we’ll learn the basic things needed in order to use “DNS-FullProtocolSimulator”.

  

“DNS-FullProtocolSimulator” is a testing environment which simulates all parts of any open-source DNS implementation and allows researchers to debug and test the protocol from end to end.

  

“DNS-FullProtocolSimulator” was created by me, **Shani Stajnrod**, as part of my thesis research. Feel free to contact me for any help via [shaaniba93@gmail.com](mailto:shaaniba93@gmail.com).

## Docker Usage

If you are unfamiliar with Docker I suggest to first read about Docker here: [https://docs.docker.com/get-started/](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)

  

1. Download the docker from Docker Hub `docker pull shanist/dnssim:latest`

2. Run the docker interactively so you can control the environment `docker container run --dns 127.0.0.1 -it dnssim /bin/bash` (It is important to use –dns 127.0.0.1 flag so the environment DNS will be local. **Changing resolv.conf inside a Docker won’t work**)

3. Now you will have a terminal inside the environment.

4. In order to open another terminal for the environment first run `docker container ls`, look for “dnssim” docker name and copy the Docker ID ![alt text](https://github.com/ShaniBenAtya/dnssim/blob/master/images/dockercontainerls.png) Run `docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash`
5. To open more terminals into the environment, repeat step 4

**Remember, in order to run `resolver` and `authoritative` you must open more than one terminal for you environment**

## Getting to know the environment
“DNS-FullProtocolSimulator”, like the DNS protocol, has three main parts: Client, Resolver (which is currently an implementation of bind9) and a chain of authoritative servers (currently including root server and TLD which are implemented with NSD).

### Environment Structure Description 

The following tree structure represent relevant folders and file in the environment with description for each one of them.

```
├── client (127.0.0.1)             
├── resolver (127.0.0.1)     
├── nsd_root (127.0.0.2)    		  - ROOT authoritative server configuration folder
│   ├── lan.forward         		  - Zone file for SLD server ".lan"
│   ├── lan.reverse
│   ├── net.forward         		  - Zone file for ROOT server ".net"
│   ├── net.reverse
│   ├── nsd.conf             		  - Configuration file for NSD, contains the IP address of the root server
│   ├── nsd.db               		  - NSD DB, for internal NSD usage
├── nsd_attack (127.0.0.200) 		  - “home.lan” malicious authoritative server configuration folder
│   ├── home.lan.forward       		  - Zone file for SLD ".home.lan", this SLD represents the malicious authoritative 
│   ├── home.lan.reverse
│   ├── nsd.conf             		  - Configuration file for NSD, contains the IP address of the malicious authoritative server
│   ├── nsd.db               		  - NSD DB, for internal NSD usage
├── named.conf               		  - Bind9 configuration, contains the IP address of the local environment
├── bind9_16_6, bind9_16_2 OR bind9_16_33 - Bind source code with modification to use local ROOT server
├── nsd                                   - NSD source code from https://github.com/NLnetLabs/nsd, this folder relevant in case of 
                                            changes to the original NSD code (In our experiment we didn't change this code)
```

### Resolver

To use the DNS protocol in a closed testing environment, I changed Bind9 implementation and directed it to use my ROOT as the default and only ROOT server. This is done by changing the `root_ns[]` list in `rootns.c` file.

Also, in order to follow the code conveniently via debugging, code optimization was disabled in the compiler and the number of threads was limited. This was done by changing the `main.c` number of CPU’s as follows:

-   `result = isc_taskmgr_create(named_g_mctx, `**`named_g_cpus`**`, 0, named_g_nm, &named_g_taskmgr);`
    

Was changed to:

-   `result = isc_taskmgr_create(named_g_mctx, `**`1`**`, 0, named_g_nm, &named_g_taskmgr);`
    

### Authoritative servers

Our authoritative servers are implemented using NSD.

Currently, we have two authoritative servers in the environment: ROOT server and a TLD which zone is “home.lan”. In the next chapter, we’ll discuss how to configure them.

## Configuration –

**Environment IP address:**

-   `127.0.0.1` – Client
    
-   `127.0.0.1` – Our own Resolver (Yeah, they have the same IP but that’s ok)
    
-   `127.0.0.2` – Root authoritative
    
-   `127.0.0.200` – “home.lan” SLD authoritative
    
-   `127.0.0.53` – The default resolver – **DO NOT USE IT WHILE TESTING**
    

**Authoritative Servers:**

Our authoritative servers are located at `/env/nsd_root` and `/env/nsd_attack`. To use them, you’ll first want to configure their zone files which are located inside their folder and called `“ZONE_NAME.forword”`. You can add any configuration you want to the zone file and restart it to apply the changes.

**Resolver:**

First, go to the resolver implementation folder (We have bind-9.16.2 (Which is vulnerable to NXNSAttack), Bind-9.16.6 (Which is non-vulnerable to NXNSAttack and vulnerable to NRDelegationAttack) and bind-9.16.33 (Which is non-vulnerable to both attacks)).
 You can easily replace the Bind9 version by going to the correct Bind9 version folder (e.g., /env/bind9_16_6, /env/bind9_16_2 or /env/bind9_16_33) and run: `make install`.
>**NOTE:** The environment is pre-installed with `Bind 9.16.6` which was the main Bind9 resolver version tested in NRDelegationAttack paper.

Now, while inside Bind9 folder follow run the following commands:

<! -- 1. `autoreconf -fi` -->
1. `./configure`
2. `make -j4`
3. `make install`
    

> **NOTE:** In order to change resolv.conf (Default resolver of the environment) look at “Docker Usage” step 2.

## Turning on all parts of the environment

Starting the environment is done by:

[Open three terminal in the Docker](#docker-usage)

-   First, turn on the Resolver:
    
    -   `cd /etc` **(IMPORTANT!!)**
        
    -  `named -g -c /etc/named.conf`
        
    -   If there is a key-error run `rndc-confgen -a` and try to start it again
        
    -   If you’re getting the following error: `“loading configuration: Permission denied”`, use the following fix:
        
        -   `chmod 777 /usr/local/etc/rndc.key`
            
        -   `chmod 777 /usr/local/etc/bind.keys`
            
-   Now, turn on the Authoritative servers in a different environment terminal:
    
    -   Navigate to the Authoritative server folder (`/env/nsd_attack` and `/env/nsd_root`), then run: `nsd -c nsd.conf -d -f nsd.db`
        
    -   If there is an error stating that the port is already in use, run - `service nsd stop` and try to start it again
        

> **YAY! YOU ARE READY TO START TESTING!!!**

### Basic Test
To make sure that the setup is ready and well configured, the following steps are required:
1. Run another shell inside the docker container using `docker exec -ti <container id> bash` and run `tcpdump -i lo -s 65535 -w /app/dump`
2. Query the resolver from within the docker container `dig firewall.home.lan` and make sure that the correct IP address is received, you should see `Address: 127.0.0.207`
3. Stop `tcpdump` (you can use `^C`), Open WireShark, load the file `<local_folder_path>/dump` and filter DNS requests. You should observe the whole DNS resolution route for the domain name requested (`firewall.home.lan`).
* `firewall.home.lan` query from client to resolver (ip `127.0.0.1` to ip `127.0.0.1`)
* Resolver query to the root server (from `127.0.0.1` to `127.0.0.2`)
* Root server return the SLD address (from `127.0.0.2` to `127.0.0.1`)
* Resolver query the SLD (from `127.0.0.1` to `127.0.0.200`)
* SLD return the address for the domain name (`127.0.0.207`)
* Resolver return the address to the client (`127.0.0.207`)
        
> **NOTE:** The address `firewall.home.lan` is configured in `/env/nsd_attack/home.lan.forward` and by performing the above test ensures that the resolver accesses the authoritative through the root server.

## Useful commands –

-   Bind’s configuration file - `/etc/named.conf`
    
-   Cache –
    
    -   To flush the cache(The resolver should be up) –
        
        -   `rndc flush`
            
        -   `rndc reload`
            
    -   To show the current cache –
        
        -   `rndc dumpdb -cache`
            
        -   cached DB location: `/etc/bind/named_dump.db`
            

## Useful tools in the environment for you to use –

“DNS-FullProtocolSimulator” already has the following useful testing tools:

-   Wireshark
	- `docker exec -ti <container id> cat /sys/class/net/eth0/iflink`
	- `ip link | grep <output from previous command>`
	- `<output from first command>`: `<name of the interface>`
	- you can also use the following tutorial: https://github.com/nicolaka/netshoot

-   Resperf:
    
    -   Send queries to the resolver in order to calculate the server maximum throughput and its latency
        
        -   `resperf -d INPUT_FILE -s 127.0.0.1 -v -R -P OUTPUT_NAME`
            
    -   In order to use resperf with constant range of queries per second:
        
        -   `resperf -d INPUT_FILE -s 127.0.0.1 -v -m 15000 -c 60 -r 0 -R -P OUTPUT_NAME`
            
        -   Where: `-m` is the number of QPS that will be sent, `-c` is the time in which resperf will try to send the queries, and `-r` is the time resperf will have an ramp-up phase before sending the packets in a constant time, we’ll want the ramp-up to be zero.
            
-   Valgrind and kcachegrind:
    
    -   Turn on the resolver with the valgrind tool:
        
        -   `valgrind --tool=callgrind named -g -c /etc/named.conf`
            
    -   After finishing the test, open the file in kcachegrind:
        
        -  First add permissions to open the file (`sudo chown USERNAME:USERNAME OUTFILE_NAME`) 
        -  Open the file: (`kcachgrind ./OUTFILE_NAME`)
            
-   psrecord: `psrecord <pid of bind9> --interval 1 --plot OUTPUT_FILE.png`
	- > **NOTE:** to find Bind9 PID use `ps aux | grep named`
